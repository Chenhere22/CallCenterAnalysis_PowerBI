# Call Center Dashboard

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard designed for analyzing the performance of a call center. The dashboard provides key metrics and visualizations to help understand the efficiency, performance, and customer experience of the call center operations.

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard includes the following main sections:

### 1. Call Volume Analysis
- **Daily and Hourly Call Volume**: A line chart showing the distribution of calls received throughout the day and week. This helps identify peak hours and allocate resources accordingly.
 
- **Call Types Breakdown**: A pie chart or bar chart categorizing the types of calls (e.g., inquiries, complaints, technical support).

### 2. Agent Performance
- **Agent Activity**: A bar chart showing the number of calls handled by each agent. This helps evaluate individual agent performance.
 
- **Average Handling Time (AHT)**: A KPI card indicating the average time taken to handle calls. Lower AHT is generally preferred, indicating efficient handling.

### 3. Customer Satisfaction
- **Customer Feedback Scores**: A bar or line chart summarizing customer feedback collected after calls, helping to assess customer satisfaction levels.
  
- **First Call Resolution (FCR)**: A key metric that shows the percentage of issues resolved during the first call, indicating the effectiveness of support provided.

### 4. Call Outcomes
- **Call Resolution Rate**: A gauge or pie chart showing the percentage of successfully resolved calls.

- **Escalation Analysis**: A visualization that indicates the number of calls that required escalation to a supervisor or a higher-level support team.
